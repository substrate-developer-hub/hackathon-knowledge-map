# Lab 6 - Tutorial: Building a Substrate Kitties dApp

## Overview

This lab combines the knowledge you've acquired by completing the readings and all the
[Substrate Runtime Development Topics](../README.md#runtime-development-topics). By completing
this lab, you will get hands-on experience on building a decentralized application that manages
the creation and ownership transfers of digital kitties.

Read through the task and submit your lab results as per the instructions under the
[Submission Instructions](#submission-instructions) instructions.

## Task

Complete the [Kitties collectables workshop](https://sacha-l.github.io/substrate-collectables-workshop/).

## Submission Instructions

1. There should be two sub-directories in the submitted directory. One is the Substrate Node, and
another one is the customized Front-end Template. Please submit the link to the github repo at the
directory level with Substrate Node and Front-end Template.

2. On the customized front-end template, create 3 kitties using Alice's account. Then transfer one
kitty to Bob, and take a screenshot. In the screenshot please include the emitted `KittyTransferred` event.
