# Quiz 4: Substrate High Level Architecture

## Overview

This quiz covers the following parts of the Substrate Knowledge Map:

- [High Level Architecture](../../knowledge-map#substrate-high-level-architecture)

### 1. A Substrate **client** contains \_ . Check all that apply.

- [ ] A. A storage component.
- [ ] B. A runtime.
- [ ] C. A peer-to-peer network component.
- [ ] D. A consensus layer.

### 2. A Substrate **runtime** contains \_. Check all that apply.

- [ ] A. All state transition functions of a Substrate blockchain, often in the form of "pallets".
- [ ] B. An executor, which dispatches calls to the runtime.
- [ ] C. The ability to compile to WASM.
- [ ] D. The business logic of a Substrate blockchain.

### 3. Substrate is \_. Check all that apply.

- [ ] A. A blockchain.
- [ ] B. Built with Rust.
- [ ] C. Can only be used with Rust.
- [ ] D. A collection of core libraries built to enable a modular and extensible approach of blockchain development.

### 4. The tradeoff between technical freedom and development ease in Substrate implies ...

- [ ] A. On one hand, Substrate comes with out-of-the-box easy to use modules for blockhain development; but on the other hand developing custom modules and blockchain architectures requires more in depth technical know-how of Substrate's CORE libraries.
- [ ] B. On one hand, Substrate is very complex; but on the other hand it's easy to learn.
- [ ] C. Substrate's flexibility is impossible to make use of without in-depth technical knowledge.
- [ ] D. Both A and B.
