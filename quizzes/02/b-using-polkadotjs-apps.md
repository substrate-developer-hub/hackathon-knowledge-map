- [Interact with a Substrate Network using Polkadot-JS Apps](../../knowledge-map#interact-with-a-substrate-network-using-polkadot-JS-Apps/) 

### 1. What operations could you perform using Polkadot-JS Apps? Check all that apply.

- [ ] Inspect the block information of a Substrate network.
- [ ] Send extrinsics to a Substrate network.
- [ ] With an embedded javascript editor, you could write javascript to interact with the connected Substrate network.
- [ ] Can act as a faucet of a Substrate network, and acquire a small amount of Substrate tokens.

- [ ] You can use Polakdot-JS Apps to connect to Bitcoin and Ethereum networks.
- [ ] You can inspect a user account in Polkadot-JS Apps but not creating a new one. You need a browser plugin to do so.
- [ ] We need to specify our own custom data type in Polkadot-JS Apps is because Substrate sent a series of bytes to its clients. So developers need to tell the Apps how to decode and interpret these bytes.

### 3. If you added custom data type in Substrate runtime, what do you need to do on Polkadot-JS Apps side to for the Apps to support this Substrate network?

- [ ] In **Setting** > **Metadata** tab, add the custom data definition in JSON form.
- [ ] In **Setting** > **Developer** tab, add the custom data definition in XML form.
- [ ] In **Setting** > **Developer** tab, add the custom data definition in JSON form.
- [ ] In **Toolbox** > **Sign message** tab, sign a message with the sudo user account for confirmation.
