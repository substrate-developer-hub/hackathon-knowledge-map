# Quiz 1: Overview

## Overview

This quiz covers the following parts of the Substrate Knowledge Map:

- [Why Substrate?](../../knowledge-map#why-substrate-substrate-blockchain-vs-smart-contract/)

- [Navigating Our Documentations](../../knowledge-map#navigating-our-documentations/)

### 1. What is correct about Substrate runtime development and Smart Contract developement? Check all that apply.

- [ ] A. Substrate gives developers total control on the blockchain.
- [ ] B. Both types of development allow you to configure transaction fees.
- [ ] C. Runtime developement usually results in faster execution, while smart contract execution is slower and more costly.
- [ ] D. It is generally easier to program with Smart Contracts and have a faster pace of development.

### 2. Identify a key characteristic that Substrate gives runtime developers. Check all that apply.

- [ ] A. Low-level access to the entire blockchain.
- [ ] B. Ability to configure the consensus engine of the Substrate network.
- [ ] C. Ability to update the runtime logic without the whole network going through a hard fork.
- [ ] D. The runtime provides a lot of safe guards and security compared to smart contract development.

### 3. I want to learn about some specific conceptual information about Subtrate. Which type of documentation should I look into?

- [ ] A. Knowledge Base
- [ ] B. Tutorials
- [ ] C. How-to Guides / Recipes
